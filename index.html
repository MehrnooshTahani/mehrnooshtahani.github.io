                            Welcome to my webpage! <!-- Starting August 2025, I will be joining the University of South Carolina as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. -->

                            Currently, I am a <a href="https://banting.fellowships-bourses.gc.ca/en/app-dem_overview-apercu.html" target="_blank">Banting Fellow</a>, sponsored by the Canadian government. With the privilege of conducting research at any eligible university worldwide as a Banting Fellow, I chose Stanford University, where I also hold a Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC) fellowship. I previously held a research associate position (Covington Fellow) at the <a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/nrc-facilities/dominion-radio-astrophysical-observatory-research-facility" target="_blank">Dominion Radio Astrophysical Observatory</a> with the National Research Council Canada (<a href="https://nrc.canada.ca/en/research-development/research-collaboration/research-centres/herzberg-astronomy-astrophysics-research-centre"  target="_blank">NRC-Herzberg</a>). 
                        </p>
                        <p>    
                            My research explores the magnetic universe through observations, theory, simulations, and instrumentation. I study how galaxies evolve to form stars by mapping interstellar magnetic fields. These field geometries act as cosmic time capsules, revealing the history of galaxies much like a dye reveals hidden patterns, offering valuable insights into our cosmic origins.

                                            Although there is an abundance of plane-of-sky magnetic field observations associated with molecular clouds, observations of their line-of-sight magnetic fields (B<sub>los</sub>) are extremely limited. To address this issue, I pioneered a <a href = "https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A%26A...614A.100T/abstract" target="_blank"> technique (named MC-BLOS)</a> based on Faraday rotation to determine B<sub>los</sub> associated with molecular clouds, outpacing Zeeman measurements. Faraday rotation is the rotation of the polarization plane of a linearly polarized electromagnetic wave as it passes through a magneto-ionic medium.

                                        <p>Due to the lower abundance of electrons in molecular clouds (a type of interstellar cloud known as a star-formation nursery) using the Faraday rotation technique to probe their magnetic fields was previously thought to be impossible, a challenge I sucessfully overcame during my PhD. The MC-BLOS technique utilizes the Faraday rotation of unresolved point sources (radio galaxies or pulsars), an ON-OFF approach, a chemical evolution code, and column density maps of the clouds. Please watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yYXGB4eF1I" target="_blank">this video</a> for a simplified explanation of the technique.</p>

                                    <h4>First Line-of-Sight Magnetic Field Maps of Some Molecular Clouds and Discovery of Magnetic Reversal</h4>
                                    <p>
                                        I mapped the line-of-sight magnetic fields of the Orion A, Orion B, Perseus, and California molecular clouds, using <a href="#research1">the MC-BLOS technique</a>.

                                            We discovered that the B<sub>los</sub> direction in three of the clouds reverses from one side to the other across the cloudâ€™s long axis. Previously, line-of-sight magnetic field reversals had only been detected in the Orion A cloud via Zeeman measurements, a finding consistent with our results. Subsequent theories postulated helical-shaped fields to explain these reversals. However, <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...632A..68T/abstract" target="_blank">my subsequent research</a> showed that an <span class="highlight">arc-shaped</span> morphology, where the field lines bend around the filament and connect to the large-scale Galactic magnetic fields, is the most probable scenario to explain the reversal.</strong>

                                                We successfully combined line-of-sight magnetic fields, plane-of-sky magnetic fields from the Planck mission, and Galactic magnetic field models to reconstruct the complete 3D magnetic fields of molecular clouds, encompassing full directions in all three dimensions. This approach establishes a novel framework for resolving the longstanding directional ambiguities associated with plane-of-sky magnetic fields that have long challenged astronomers.

This field geometry is concave from our point of view, with the field lines pointing in the direction of decreasing longitude when projected onto the plane of the sky. The determination of 3D field vectors allowed me to propose a detailed step-by-step formation and evolution scenario for the Perseus cloud, closely linked to the influence of nearby super-bubbles.

                                        In reconstructing the 3D magnetic field vectors of clouds, we also consider the 3D shapes of the clouds. The Orion A cloud presents a more complex geometry compared to the Perseus cloud; its head lies parallel to the plane of the sky, while its tail is inclined at a 70-degree angle. This complexity introduces greater uncertainties in determining the 3D field vectors and complicates our understanding of the cloud's formation, history, and evolution.

I found that both the Orion-Eridanus bubble and a nearby dust ring have influenced Orion A's formation and evolution. Interestingly, the famous Barnard's Loop has only interacted with the head of the cloud, which explains the higher rate of star formation observed in the head.

                                    <p>
                                        Dust polarization offers a powerful method for observing interstellar magnetic fields. This technique is based on the alignment of the long axis of elongated interstellar dust grains perpendicular to magnetic fields and reveals only the plane-of-sky component of magnetic fields (though not their direction). To apply this method, we conducted observations of the NGC 6334 molecular cloud, a massive star-forming region within the Galactic disk, using the <a href="https://www.eaobservatory.org/jcmt/" target="_blank">James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT)</a> within the BISTRO collaboration. These observations not only allowed us to map the magnetic field structure of this cloud but also enabled an analysis of the hot ionized atomic hydrogen (HII) regions surrounding newly formed massive stars, providing a comprehensive view of the cloud's magnetic environment.

I also developed an algorithm to characterize this alignment and quantify the impact of HII regions on magnetic fields. The orientation of magnetic field lines relative to the HII bubbles provides crucial insights into the dynamic processes that drive cloud evolution and trigger secondary star formation, underscoring the complex interplay between magnetic fields, feedback processes, and interstellar medium dynamics.

                                                Magnetism plays important roles in the evolution of galaxies and the formation of clouds and stars, yet observing magnetic fields presents significant challenges. In <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ASPC..534..193P/abstract" target="_blank">this Protostars and Planets VII book chapter</a>, we provide a comprehensive review of the past decade's advancements in studying interstellar magnetic fields, from Galactic clouds to prestellar cores. For an overview of this decade-long progress in interstellar magnetic field research, you can watch my Protostars and Planets VII conference talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXokECagqA8&ab_channel=ProtostarsandPlanetsVII" target="_blank">here</a>.

                                                Within the Galactic Polarization Working Group of the CCAT-Prime collaboration, we are planning comprehensive surveys of plane-of-sky magnetic fields, including both shallow and deep observations. Our goals include determining the 3D magnetic fields of various molecular clouds and exploring magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence, dust properties, and the interconnected evolution of clouds and their magnetic fields. This research extends to both Galactic and extraGalactic environments.

The results consistently supported my earlier observational findings of arc-shaped morphologies in molecular clouds, reinforcing the robustness of this conclusion across a range of parameters.

                                        I have taught twice as a Sessional Instructor at the University of Calgary, where I was responsible for all aspects of course delivery, including course design. I also have served as a teaching assistant and guest lecturer in various courses across multiple universities, teaching in two languages (English and Farsi/Persian).

                                        I am enthusiastic about sharing the wonders and excitement of exploring physics and astronomy. Over the years, I've embraced more than 35 service and outreach roles, ranging from founding initiatives to organizing conferences, and from leading to supporting various events. One of these efforts includes co-founding the <a href="https://openculturalastronomyforum.github.io/" target="_blank">Open Cultural Astronomy Forum (OCAF)</a> with Ray Norris, an initiative dedicated to exploring the interplay between astronomy and cultures.
